# Review of foostats.pl

This review provides suggestions for improving the `foostats.pl` Perl script. The script is well-structured and uses modern Perl features, but there are several areas where it could be enhanced.

## 1. Code Duplication

There are some instances of code duplication that could be refactored for better maintainability:

*   In `Foostats::Aggregator::add_feed_ips`, the code for handling `GEMFEED_URI` and `GEMFEED_URI_2` is identical. This could be simplified by using a loop or a regex.
*   The logic for parsing web and gemini logs in `Foostats::Logreader` shares some similarities and could potentially be generalized.

Implemented:
- Simplified `add_feed_ips` with a single regex that matches `/gemfeed/` and `/gemfeed/index.gmi` (including optional query strings), removing duplicated branches.
- Made log path globs configurable at runtime via `FOOSTATS_WEB_LOGS_GLOB` and `FOOSTATS_GEMINI_LOGS_GLOB` and refactored constant globs into functions. This reduces coupling and enables shared `read_lines` usage for both parsers and testing.

## 2. Dependencies

*   **List dependencies in `README.md`:** At a minimum, list the required modules in the `README.md` file with instructions on how to install them.

Implemented:
- Added a dedicated Dependencies section in `README.md` with core and CPAN modules.
- Included OpenBSD package names, adding `p5-HTML-Parser` (provides `HTML::Entities`) which is used by the HTML report generator.

## 3. Testing

The script lacks an automated test suite. Adding tests would significantly improve its reliability and make future development easier and safer.

*   **Use `Test::More`:** Perl's core `Test::More` module is the standard for writing tests.
*   **Test individual components:** Write tests for each package, especially for the log parsing and data aggregation logic.
*   **Create mock data:** Create sample log files to test the parsing logic under different scenarios.

Implemented:
- Converted the script to avoid executing the CLI when `require`-d by wrapping the main flow into `foostats_main()` and calling it `unless caller`. This allows unit testing of internal packages.
- Added basic tests under `t/`:
  - `t/00-load.t`: loads the script.
  - `t/01-aggregator.t`: verifies feed IP aggregation for Atom and Gemfeed and page IP tracking.
  - `t/02-filter.t`: verifies excessive request filtering behavior.
  - `t/03-logreader-web.t`: parses a minimal mocked web access log via `FOOSTATS_WEB_LOGS_GLOB`.
- Introduced env-configurable log globs to enable tests to point at mock logs without touching system paths.
- Added `.perltidyrc` and a `Justfile` with `format`, `test`, `check`, and `clean` tasks to standardize formatting and developer workflow (replaced `Makefile`).
 - Added a `reports` task to the `Justfile` to generate Gemtext and HTML reports locally from the repo's `stats/` directory into `out_gmi/` and `out_html/`.

## 4. Readability and Style

The script is generally well-written, but a few things could improve its readability:

*   **Remove debugging code:** The script contains `use diagnostics;` and `use Data::Dumper;` with "TODO: UNDO" comments. This debugging code should be removed from the production version of the script.
*   **Add comments:** Some of the more complex parts of the script, like the data structures used for statistics, could benefit from comments explaining their structure and purpose.
*   **Consistent formatting:** While the formatting is mostly consistent, a tool like `perltidy` could be used to enforce a standard style across the entire script.

Implemented:
- Removed `use diagnostics;` and `use Data::Dumper;` from production code.
- Added comments describing the stats data model in `Foostats::Aggregator`.
- Added explicit `use HTML::Entities qw(encode_entities);` in `Foostats::Reporter` and documented dependency.

Open items / Next steps:
- Consider further generalization between web and gemini parsers if beneficial (e.g., a unified parse event builder).
- Optionally run `perltidy` and adopt a formatter config for consistent style across the codebase.
 - Consider adding more parser tests (Gemini vger/relayd sample lines, edge cases like query strings and unusual paths).
